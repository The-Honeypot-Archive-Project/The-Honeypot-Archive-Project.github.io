We love honeypots. Deception technology helps us get a glimpse of attackers' behaviors like no other tool can give us. Our initiative has two core activities that help fulfill our mission. First, we are building The Honeypot Dataset, a structured honeypot dataset for the community that allows searching for honeypots quickly. Second, we are running a Honeypot Adoption Program to help preserve orphan honeypot software, no longer maintained by their owners for many years.
